# import the function as below : 

from prep_for_headers import prep 


read the code from file like below:
with open('4398.cpp', 'r') as myfile:
    data=myfile.read()

and call the function 
x = prep(data)...It will return a list of 2 lists, those 2 lists are required for running kailash's program
so maybe call kailash's code like.

find_all_used_header(data,x[0],x[1]).
